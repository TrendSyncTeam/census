We are driven by the excitement of building technologies, inventing products, and providing services that change lives. We embrace new ways of doing things, make decisions quickly, and are not afraid to fail. We have the scope and capabilities of a large company, and the spirit and heart of a small one.\n\nTogether, Amazonians research and develop new technologies from Amazon Web Services to Alexa on behalf of our customers: shoppers, sellers, content creators, and developers around the world.\n\nOur mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company. Our actions, goals, projects, programs, and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind.\n\nYou'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always \""Day 1.\"" What do we mean?

But there's been one huge obstacle: quantum systems are incredibly fragile and prone to errors. \n\nToday marks a breakthrough. We just unveiled Ocelot, Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s new quantum chip that takes a completely different approach to this challenge. \n\nOur team used a novel design for Ocelot's architecture, building error correction in from the ground up, leveraging special quantum bits (called 'cat qubits'). They naturally resist errors, much like building immunity into the system itself rather than trying to fix errors after they happen.\n\nWe're the first to successfully put this technology into an integrated microchip that can be manufactured using fabrication processes adopted from the microelectronics industry. That means we‚Äôve reduced the resources needed for error correction by as much as 90%, accelerating our path to practical quantum computing by an estimated 5 years. \n\nThink of this like going from unreliable vacuum tubes to dependable transistors in early computing‚Äîa fundamental shift that turned possibilities into reality. From discovering new medicines faster, to developing better clean energy solutions, we're accelerating the path to real-world quantum computing. \n\nWhile there's still a lot more work ahead here, I'm super proud of the team's achievement.
