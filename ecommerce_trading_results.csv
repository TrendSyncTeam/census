We are driven by the excitement of building technologies, inventing products, and providing services that change lives. We embrace new ways of doing things, make decisions quickly, and are not afraid to fail. We have the scope and capabilities of a large company, and the spirit and heart of a small one.\n\nTogether, Amazonians research and develop new technologies from Amazon Web Services to Alexa on behalf of our customers: shoppers, sellers, content creators, and developers around the world.\n\nOur mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company. Our actions, goals, projects, programs, and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind.\n\nYou'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always \""Day 1.\"" What do we mean? That our approach remains the same as it was on Amazon's very first day - to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, invent, and focus on delighting our customers.\n          "",""website"":""https://www.aboutamazon.com/"",""locations"":[""2127 7th Ave., Seattle, WA 98109, US"",""12900 Worldgate Dr, Herndon, VA 20170, US"",""7200 Discovery Dr, Chattanooga, TN 37416, US"",""1100 Enterprise Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, US"",""2010 Broening Hwy, Baltimore, MD 21224, US"",""Buyukdere Caddesi 185, Istanbul, Istanbul 34394, TR"",""Via de las Dos Castillas, 33, Pozuelo de Alarcon, Community of Madrid 28224, ES"",""Im Gewerbepark, Regensburg, Bavaria 93059, DE"",""8 Exhibition St, Melbourne, VIC 3000, AU"",""705 Boulder Dr, Breinigsville, PA 18031, US"",""2700 Regent Blvd, Irving, TX 75063, US"",""500 Kinetic Dr, Huntington, WV 25701, US"",""1125 Remington Blvd, Romeoville, IL 60446, US"",""Burlington Road, Dublin, County Dublin, IE"",""109 Braid St, New Westminster, BC V3L 5H4, CA"",""Solan Rd, Cape Town, Western Cape 8001, ZA"",""2700 Center Dr, Dupont, WA 98327, US"",""8000 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89506, US"",""4848 Perrin Creek, San Antonio, TX 78217, US"",""1555 N Chrisman Rd, Tracy, CA 95304, US"",""60 Holborn Viaduct, London, England EC1A 2FD, GB"",""120 Bremner Blvd, Toronto, ON M5J 0A8, CA"",""31 Rives de Clausen, Luxembourg, Luxembourg 2165, LU"",""Sunbank Lane, Altrincham, England WA15 0, GB"",""86 5th St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308, US"",""402 John Dodd Rd, Spartanburg, SC 29303, US"",""Waterloo Place, Edinburgh, Scotland EH1 3EG, GB"",""Am Brauhaus 12, Dresden, SN 01099, DE"",""3501 120th Ave, Kenosha, WI 53144, US"",""24208 San Michele Rd, Moreno Valley, CA 92551, US"",""Calle del Hierro, 21, Madrid, Community of Madrid 28045, ES"",""50 Airways Blvd, Nashville, TN 37217, US"",""3350 Laurel Ridge Ave, Ruskin, FL 33570, US"",""4255 Anson Blvd, Whitestown, IN 46075, US"",""2170 RT-27, Edison, NJ 08817, US"",""560 Merrimac Ave, Middletown, DE 19709, US"",""150 W Jefferson Ave, Detroit, MI 48226, US"",""101 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142, US"",""1800 140th Ave E, Sumner, WA 98390, US"",""5000 Commerce Way, Petersburg, VA 23803, US"",""50 New Canton Way, Robbinsville Township, NJ 08691, US"",""12900 Pecan Park Rd, Jacksonville, FL 32218, US"",""4400 12th Street Ext, West Columbia, SC 29172, US"",""2 Park St, Sydney, NSW 2000, AU"",""510 W Georgia St, Vancouver, BC V6B 0M3, CA"",""7290 Investment Dr, North Charleston, SC 29418, US"",""11999 National Rd SW, Pataskala, OH 43062, US"",""6400 Avenue 6000, Cork, County Cork T12 D292, IE"",""96 E San Fernando St, San Jose, CA 95113, US"",""Namestie 1. maja 7286/18, Bratislava, Bratislava 811 06, SK"",""Rue de Planque, Lauwin-Planque, Hauts-de-France 59553, FR"",""23 Church St, Singapore, Singapore 049481, SG"",""8120 Humble Westfield Rd, Humble, TX 77338, US"",""2996 Ramona Ave, Sacramento, CA 95826, US"",""801 30 St NE, Calgary, AB T2A 5L7, CA"",""3610 NW Saint Helens Rd, Portland, OR 97210, US"",""Avenida Juan Salvador Agraz 73, Cuajimalpa de Morelos, CDMX 05348, MX"",""8050 Heritage Rd, Brampton, ON L6Y 0C9, CA"",""Evropska 2758/11, Prague, Prague 160 00, CZ"",""1910 E Central Ave, San Bernardino, CA 92408, US"",""1414 S Council Rd, Oklahoma City, OK 73128, US"",""1401 E McCarty Ln, San Marcos, TX 78666, US"",""Habibullah Road, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600017, IN"",""188 Spear St, San Francisco, CA 94105, US"",""Via delle Mechanica, Fara in Sabina, Laz. 02032, IT"",""2302 Marietta Blvd NW, Atlanta, GA 30318, US"",""Lane Ct, Sterling, VA 20166, US"",""Sapir, Herzliya, Tel Aviv 46000, IL"",""462 Hazelwood Logistics Center Dr, Hazelwood, MO 63042, US"",""390 Interlocken Crescent, Broomfield, CO 80021, US"",""10201 Torre Ave, Cupertino, CA 95014, US"",""700 Westport Pkwy, Fort Worth, TX 76177, US"",""763 SE Kasota Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55414, US"",""1850 Mercer Rd, Lexington, KY 40511, US"",""4411 W 2100 S, West Valley City, UT 84120, US"",""Carrer de l'Alta Ribagorca, El Prat de Llobregat, Catalonia 08820, ES"",""11501 Alterra Pkwy, Austin, TX 78758, US"",""Sikanderpur Flyover, Gurugram, HR 122008, IN"",""2277 Center Square Rd, Logan Township, NJ 08085, US"",""Marcel-Breuer-Stra√üe 12, Munich, Bavaria 80807, DE""],""employees"":[{""img"":""https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2"",""title"":""Steven Hatch"",""subtitle"":""Experienced Amazon Engineering Leader | Generative AI at Amazon""},{""img"":""https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2"",""title"":""Brendon Wilson"",""subtitle"":""Product Management Leader | Voice | Cloud | AI""},{""img"":""https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2"",""title"":""Kara H.

They naturally resist errors, much like building immunity into the system itself rather than trying to fix errors after they happen.\n\nWe're the first to successfully put this technology into an integrated microchip that can be manufactured using fabrication processes adopted from the microelectronics industry. That means we‚Äôve reduced the resources needed for error correction by as much as 90%, accelerating our path to practical quantum computing by an estimated 5 years. \n\nThink of this like going from unreliable vacuum tubes to dependable transistors in early computing‚Äîa fundamental shift that turned possibilities into reality. From discovering new medicines faster, to developing better clean energy solutions, we're accelerating the path to real-world quantum computing. \n\nWhile there's still a lot more work ahead here, I'm super proud of the team's achievement.

You can control multiple smart devices with a single request, create Alexa Routines entirely by voice, and Alexa will even infer what you mean without an explicit request‚Äîlike understanding it should adjust the temperature on your smart thermostat when you say you‚Äôre cold, or dim the lights when you say it‚Äôs too bright.  \n\nAlexa  costs $19.99 per month or free to all Amazon Prime members, and will start rolling out in the U.S. in the next few weeks.
